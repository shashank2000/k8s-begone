# k8s-begone

A way to automate your Kubernetes deployments.

You'd have to specify a bunch of docker containers that you'd like a Kubernetes cluster, and a natural language description of what the nodes should look like, and it applies all the commands and generates all the configs necessary.

So this is a managed Kubernetes service lol. But not really. Because you're still very much running Kubernetes - think of this tool as an assistant.
